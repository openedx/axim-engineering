# This workflow runs when a ticket is created.
# It adds the github-request label, tags on-call, and posts in Axim's internal slack channel.
#
# Separately, Axim's project board (https://github.com/orgs/openedx/projects/8)
# automatically adds all issues from this repo.

  #       Since May 2024, we only use this repo for on-call issues, so we just add the label to everything.
